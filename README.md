# Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence

This project was developed to keep all algorithms which was developed for Advanced Topics in
Artificial Intelligence module. The main goal was study techniques for:
- Text preprocessing.
- Text sumarization.
- Information retrieval.

## What was developed in the project?
1. [The Porter Stemming Algorithm](http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/porter/stemmer.html)
2. Text Summarizer using Term Weights
3. A Boolean Model for Information Retrieval

## Requirements
  - Python 2.7
  - Nltk

## Installing requirements:
* First you have to cretate virtual enviroment for the project. We use virtualenvwrapper for this
 task.

    ```mkvirtualenv ATAI```

* Now we need ensure that the virtual enviroment is active.

    ```workon ATAI```

* Finally we must install the project's requirements.

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## How it works?
You can find usage examples in demo folder.
